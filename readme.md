# Dream.mf Framework
Modern Frontend Libraries for use with Microfrontends and other javascript technologies.

## Builds

⚫ **Core:** The standard runtime available to all packages which use Dream.mf. This library allows debug, logging, and configuration to be visible by using `window.DreamMF` to view.

⚫ **Logging:** Generic event based logger built to handle logging in any layer of a module federated application in any javascript framework, it also allows capture and configure out log aggregation in one place, so that even remotes do not need to be aware of how or where we are logging, greatly reducing the config footprint of a remote and allowing it to be far more portable.
